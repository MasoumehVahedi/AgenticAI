## üåê What Is the OpenAI API?
The OpenAI library is lightweight ‚Äî it is not an LLM or neural network itself.

It simply wraps HTTP calls to a standard API format.

We send structured requests (like lists of dictionaries) to OpenAI‚Äôs endpoints.
Many other providers now follow this same format, making it easy to swap models.

## Why We Use OpenAI Code to Call Gemini

Simple ‚Äî the OpenAI Python client just sends HTTP requests using a common API format.

Since OpenAI's API format became widely adopted, many providers (like Gemini) support the same structure.
