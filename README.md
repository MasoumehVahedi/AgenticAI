## ðŸ›  Installation and Sync Setup

To install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then, verify installation:

```bash
which uv
uv --version


To ensure the binary is accessible, make sure this is in your shell config (e.g., ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):

export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"


Reload your shell:

source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
